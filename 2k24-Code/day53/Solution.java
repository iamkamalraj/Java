//787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
//
//There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.
//
//You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.
//
// 
//
//Example 1:
//
//
//Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
//Output: 700
//Explanation:
//The graph is shown above.
//The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
//Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.
//Example 2:
//
//
//Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
//Output: 200
//Explanation:
//The graph is shown above.
//The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.
//Example 3:
//
//
//Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
//Output: 500
//Explanation:
//The graph is shown above.
//The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.
// 
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= n <= 100
//0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
//flights[i].length == 3
//0 <= fromi, toi < n
//fromi != toi
//1 <= pricei <= 104
//There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
//0 <= src, dst, k < n
//src != dst
